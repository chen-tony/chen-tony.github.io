Research to come!

The beauty of biostatistics is that there is always something new to learn, whether from clinical or statistical research. My current research interests are in high-dimensional statistics and machine learning, particularly in genetics/genomics and electronic health records data. I hope to develop statistical and computational methods that can be used to inform clinical decisions and develop a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of human health.
