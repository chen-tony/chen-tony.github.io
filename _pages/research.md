Starting my academic career towards the start of this big data boom, I am interested in developing novel methodology to analyze complicated data. I hope to pursue research that balances grounded statistical theory with relevant applications through collaboration. Genomics and electronic health records present challenging but exciting mathematical and scientific features, and I believe that proper analysis can deepen our understanding of human health and power medical decisions.
