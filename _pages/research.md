Research to come!

My current research interests are in high-dimensional statistics and machine learning, particularly in genetics/genomics and electronic health records data. I hope to develop statistical and computational methodology that can be used to inform clinical decisions and develop a better understanding of the underlying biological mechanisms of human health.
