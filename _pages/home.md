Welcome to my website! This is still under construction, so I apologize in advance for any and all issues you may run into.

I am currently a PhD Student in the [Department of Biostatistics](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/biostatistics/) at the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health. My research interests lie broadly in high-dimensional statistics with primary applications to genetics and genomics.
