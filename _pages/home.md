I am currently a PhD candidate in the [Department of Biostatistics](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/biostatistics/) at the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health, advised by [Professor Xihong Lin](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/lin-lab/). My dissertation is focused on developing novel methods for polygenic risk scores from large-scale biobanks and association studies. I also have several collaborations with the [International Lung Cancer Consortium](https://ilcco.iarc.fr). 

Before my PhD, I completed my Bachelor's degree from the [Department of Operations Research and Financial Engineering](https://orfe.princeton.edu/) at Princeton University, with a certificate in Statistics and Machine Learning. I was advised by [Professor Jianqing Fan](https://fan.princeton.edu/) for my senior thesis, which explored high-dimensional variable selection and missing data.
