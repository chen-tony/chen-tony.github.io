I am currently a PhD Student in the [Department of Biostatistics](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/biostatistics/) at the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health. My research interests lie broadly in high-dimensional statistics and machine learning methodology, with applications to genomics and electronic health records. 

I have a Bachelor's degree from the [Department of Operations Research and Financial Engineering](https://orfe.princeton.edu/) at Princeton University, with a certificate in Statistics and Machine Learning. I was advised by [Professor Jianqing Fan](https://fan.princeton.edu/) for my senior thesis, which explored high-dimensional variable selection and missing data.
