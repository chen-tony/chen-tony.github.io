# SPLENDID
SPLENDID uses a group-L0L1 penalized regression on biobank-scale individual-level data, incorporating genetic interactions with ancestry PCs to simultaneously model shared and heterogeneous effects across diverse ancestries. Available as command-line R software (built primarily off of bigstatsr software), with examples and tutorials [here](https://github.com/chen-tony/SPLENDID)

# ALL-Sum
ALL-Sum applies a fast L0L2 penalized regression and ensemble learning to compute PRS from GWAS summary statistics and LD. Analysis of ~1.5 million SNPs takes about 30 minutes and 20 GB without parallelization. Available as command-line R software (requires a few R packages and plink2), with examples and tutorials [here](https://github.com/chen-tony/ALL-Sum)
